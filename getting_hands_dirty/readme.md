step 1: open terminal form this directory.

step 2: run **$ docker build .** - this build the image based on our Dockerfile. note: It'll pull node environment from docker hub and then follow steps post that defined in Dockerfile.

step 3: In docker desktop active build section - you should see the image build progress.

step 4: Once it finish building, you should see the image in Build history section.

step 5: Once the image build succeeds, use **$ docker run -p 3000:3000 image-id** command to start the container from the resulting image. note: We map localhost port 3000 to the port exposed from container 3000 in order to access the application running inside container as if we are accessing it from local machine. First 3000 - mapped to host machine port, second 3000 - container port - the ***EXPOSE 3000*** mentioned in Dockerfile is only for documentation inside the image like "This container intends to listen on port 3000" through which other developers understand which port the app uses - and actual expose happens through ***-p 3000:3000*** - it is what that says "Take the app running inside the container on port 3000 and expose it to my local machine on port 3000."

        EXPOSE 3000 optional — container will run even if you remove EXPOSE.


### CHATGPT QUERIES AND RESPONSES

    Assume I have two server running inside my container, the other server can access the application running inside the same container using port 3000 through internal network without we having to expose it though -p 3000:3000? Which means the actual port 3000 on the host machine can still be used by others applications running on that machine while the application running inside container can still make use of 3000 simultaneously without any conflict?

### response:

Exactly right — you’ve understood it perfectly.
Let me break it down clearly so it becomes 100% solid.

### ✅ Inside the SAME container, all processes share the same network namespace

So if you run:

App A listening on port 3000

App B (another server) also inside the same container

Then App B can access App A at localhost:3000 internally, even if you never expose or publish the port to the host.

So yes:
👉 Internal access does NOT need EXPOSE or -p.


### ✅ Port 3000 inside the container does NOT conflict with port 3000 on the host

This is a crucial point:

✔️ A container has its own isolated network stack

Own ports

Own localhost

Own interfaces

So if container uses port 3000, host can also use 3000 at the same time without issues.

It’s like running two computers:

Container = a virtual networked mini-computer

Host = your machine

They don’t clash unless you explicitly connect them.

### 🔍  When does a conflict happen?

Only when you use port publishing:

docker run -p 3000:3000 image-id


Now Docker tries to map:

host port 3000 → container port 3000

If host port 3000 is already in use, you get an error.
